## How to Run the Site:
<pre>python app.py</pre>

## General Instructions
- The program assumes that there is a mysql service already running with a appropriately named database (in this case it was "newestdb")
- To make sure the program works for you open "functions.py" and change the mysql connection lines to reflect the userid and password of your mysql service and also to change the name of the db to your liking.
- db needs to be made in the mysql cli before app.py can properly integrate with it
